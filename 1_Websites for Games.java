**Here are some additional factors to consider when downloading games:**

- **System Requirements:** Make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements to run the game before you download it. Downloading a large game can be time-consuming, only to find out your PC can't handle it.
- **Disk Space:** Games can take up a significant amount of disk space. Check the game's file size before downloading to ensure you have enough space on your hard drive.
- **Reviews and Ratings:** Read reviews and ratings from other players before downloading a game. This can help you get a sense of the game's quality and avoid downloading something you won't enjoy.

**Examples of downloadable PC games (these may require additional downloads or launcher installations):**

- **Grand Theft Auto V** (Action-adventure)
